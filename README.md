## Work Experience

### Autonomous Data Analyst
- Structuring and organizing datasets for an important energy efficiency company. The data was later used to analyse predicted impacts of potential energy efficiency projects in industrial complexes.

### Physical Therapist @Tigres F.C. / Club Universidad Nacional A.C.
- Guide and oversee injured athletes return of athletes to play for "Club Universidad Nacional A.C." 
- Perform physical tests on "Tigres F.C." athletes, analyze data and provide reports of the results.
- Implement injury prevention tactics using Data Analysis tools

### Research Assistant @ Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León (2018-2023 sporadic depending on project availability)
- Collaborate to publish research papers in rehabilitation and sports science scientific journals 
- Handle data and perform analysis to interpret experimental results
- Research through several sources to start and support experimental designs

### English-Spanish Interpreter

## Projects

#### Energy Efficiency Model / Energy Cost calculation using weather records.
This project was aimed to determine the energy demands and costs to implement certain energy efficiency strategies in industrial complexes and compare them to the current demands and costs these complexes have.

For this, I gathered raw temperature, humidity and atmospheric pressure data for each hour and day from January 1st, 2022 to December 31st, 2023. Then I completed several complex calculations for engineering purposes. Some of these calculations include enthalpy, cooling tons and kW consumption.

It was also needed to categorize the hour and date based on several criteria (depending on the Mexican electricity comission norms) to ultimately calculate the expected costs of energy consumption.

This data was converted into useful visualizations that allowed the stakeholders to identify the economic benefit.

This was all modelled using R to work with the complex calculations, EXCEL to organize the data and get basic previews with pivot tables and finally POWER BI for the visualization part of the project.

#### Athlete Physical Perfomance Assesment Analysis
We performed several physical performance tests in more than 100 professional athletes from soccer team Tigres F.C. (https://www.tigres.com.mx/es/). More than 20 metrics were used for each athlete. They were also divided in 6 different categories based on age and sex.

I was assigned to create the database and perform the analysis for the stakeholders to make decisions about the athletes training program. 

The dataset was created and manipulated solely with EXCEL.
